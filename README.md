# AIR-CANVAS
✨ Air Canvas – Gesture-Based Virtual Drawing Tool Air Canvas is an innovative project that lets users draw in the air using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, it enables real-time hand tracking for color selection, drawing, and erasing on a digital canvas — all without physical contact or traditional tools.
