# AIR-CANVAS
âœ¨ Air Canvas â€“ Gesture-Based Virtual Drawing Tool
Air Canvas is an innovative project that lets users draw in the air using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, it enables real-time hand tracking for color selection, drawing, and erasing on a digital canvas â€” all without physical contact or traditional tools.
